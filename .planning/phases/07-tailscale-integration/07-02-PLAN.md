<objective>
Deploy the Tailscale-enabled build, verify Control UI works via HTTPS, confirm sub-agents still function, and validate persistence across restarts.

Purpose: All code changes from Plan 01 must be deployed and tested end-to-end. This is a human verification checkpoint since visual UI testing and multi-device networking cannot be automated.
Output: Confirmed working deployment with Control UI accessible via Tailscale HTTPS.

  <name>Task 1: Pre-deploy — User Tailscale setup</name>
  <what-built>Plan 01 committed all code changes. Before deploying, the user must complete Tailscale account setup.</what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
Complete these steps (one-time setup):

1. **Create Tailscale account** (if not already done):
   - Go to https://login.tailscale.com
   - Sign up (free tier: 100 devices, 3 users)

2. **Create ACL tag** for the server:
   - Tailscale Admin -> Access Controls
   - Add `"tag:server"` to the `tagOwners` section
   - Save

3. **Create OAuth client secret**:
   - Tailscale Admin -> Settings -> OAuth clients -> Generate OAuth client
   - Scope: `devices` (write) — this allows creating auth keys
   - Tags: `tag:server`
   - Copy the `tskey-client-...` secret

4. **Add to Coolify environment**:
   - Coolify Dashboard -> openclaw service -> Environment Variables
   - Add: `TS_AUTHKEY=tskey-client-...` (the secret from step 3)
   - Add: `TS_HOSTNAME=openclaw-server` (optional, sets the tailnet machine name)

5. **Enable MagicDNS**:
   - Tailscale Admin -> DNS -> Enable MagicDNS

6. **Install Tailscale on MacBook**:
   - `brew install --cask tailscale`
   - Open Tailscale.app and login with the same account
   - Verify: `tailscale status` shows your MacBook connected

7. **Push the commit** to trigger Coolify deploy:
   - `git push origin main`
   - Watch Coolify build logs for the new tailscale-install stage
   - Wait for deploy to complete (first build may take longer due to new stage)

Type "deployed" when the container is running and Tailscale setup is complete.

<task type="checkpoint:human-verify" gate="blocking">
  <name>Task 2: Post-deploy — Verify Tailscale + Control UI + sub-agents</name>
  <what-built>Tailscale Serve should now be proxying HTTPS traffic to the openclaw gateway on loopback. Control UI should be accessible via the MagicDNS URL.</what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
**Step 1: Check Tailscale status on server**
```bash
# SSH into server
sshpass -p '@pack86N5891' ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -o PreferredAuthentications=password ameer@192.168.1.100

# Check container tailscale status
CONTAINER=$(sudo docker ps --format '{{.Names}}' | grep openclaw | head -1)
sudo docker exec "$CONTAINER" tailscale --socket=/var/run/tailscale/tailscaled.sock status
```
Expected: Shows "openclaw-server" with a 100.x.x.x IP and "Running" state.

**Step 2: Get the MagicDNS URL**
```bash
sudo docker exec "$CONTAINER" tailscale --socket=/var/run/tailscale/tailscaled.sock status | head -3
```
Note the tailnet name (e.g., `tail12345.ts.net`). Your Control UI URL is: `https://openclaw-server.TAILNET.ts.net`

**Step 3: Access Control UI from MacBook**
- Open browser on MacBook
- Navigate to `https://openclaw-server.TAILNET.ts.net`
- Expected: Control UI loads WITHOUT "requires secure context" error
- Expected: Valid HTTPS certificate (no browser warning)
- Enter the gateway token when prompted

**Step 4: Verify sub-agents still work**
- In Control UI or via chat, trigger a sub-agent (e.g., ask OpenClaw to research something that spawns a sub-agent)
- Expected: Sub-agent spawns and connects without "ECONNREFUSED" errors
- Check logs: `sudo docker logs "$CONTAINER" 2>&1 | tail -50`

**Step 5: Verify LAN access is gone (expected)**
```bash
# From MacBook terminal:
curl -s http://192.168.1.100:18789/health
```
Expected: Connection refused or timeout (this is correct — bind=loopback means no LAN access)

**Step 6: Verify n8n is NOT on tailnet**
```bash
sudo docker exec "$CONTAINER" tailscale --socket=/var/run/tailscale/tailscaled.sock status
```
Expected: Only openclaw-server and your MacBook in the list. No n8n, searxng, or other services.

**Step 7: Verify restart persistence**
```bash
# Restart the container
sudo docker restart "$CONTAINER"
# Wait 60 seconds for startup
sleep 60
# Check tailscale reconnected automatically
sudo docker exec "$CONTAINER" tailscale --socket=/var/run/tailscale/tailscaled.sock status
```
Expected: Tailscale reconnects automatically from persisted state (no re-auth needed).

**Step 8: Update connect-mac-node.sh**
- Edit `scripts/connect-mac-node.sh` on your Mac
- Replace `CHANGE-ME` with your actual tailnet name
- Test: `./scripts/connect-mac-node.sh`
- Expected: Node connects via Tailscale HTTPS, browser control works

Report results for each step. If any step fails, describe what happened.

  <resume-signal>Report results for all 8 steps, or describe any failures</resume-signal>

All verification is human-driven (network + browser testing):
1. Control UI loads via HTTPS MagicDNS URL
2. Sub-agents spawn without errors
3. n8n is not visible on tailnet
4. Container restart preserves Tailscale state
5. connect-mac-node.sh works with Tailscale URL
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- Control UI accessible from MacBook browser via HTTPS (no "secure context" error)
- Sub-agents continue to work (loopback-native, no temp patch)
- n8n has NO Tailscale access — LAN-only unchanged
- Gateway survives container restart without re-auth (state persisted in /data/tailscale/)
- TS_AUTHKEY stored in Coolify env (via BWS or direct)
- connect-mac-node.sh works with Tailscale MagicDNS URL
</success_criteria>
